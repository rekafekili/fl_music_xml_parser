# fl_music_xml_parser

Welcome to the Flutter MusicXML Parser library! This library provides an easy and efficient way to parse MusicXML files into `ScoreXml` objects within your Flutter applications. MusicXML is a widely used format for representing musical scores, and with this library, you can seamlessly integrate music notation into your Flutter apps.

## Development Approach

I believe in developing this library incrementally to ensure robustness and reliability. Starting with the sample files provided on the official MusicXML website, we test and enhance the parser to handle a wide variety of MusicXML elements and attributes. This approach allows us to deliver a stable and comprehensive solution that evolves with each iteration, catering to the diverse needs of music notation applications.
